# Contributing to Awesome Agent Skills

A curated list of Agent Skills for AI coding assistants. We organize links to skills hosted in their own repositories.

## Adding a Skill

### Entry Format

Add your skill to the end of the relevant category in `README.md`:

```markdown
- **[author/skill-name](https://github.com/author/repo/path)** - Short description of what it does
```

### Where to Add

- **Development team skills**: If your team has an existing section (e.g. "Skills by Vercel Engineering Team"), add to the end of that section.
- **Community skills**: Add to the end of the matching subcategory under "Community Skills" (Marketing, Productivity and Collaboration, Development and Testing, Context Engineering, AI and Data, n8n Automation, or Other).
- If no existing category fits, add to "Other".

### Requirements

- Public repository with a working skill
- Has documentation (README or SKILL.md)
- Author/org prefix included in the name
- Description must be short, 10 words or fewer. No lengthy paragraphs.
- Skill must have real community usage. We focus on community-adopted, proven skills. Brand new skills that were just created are not accepted. Give your skill time to mature and gain users before submitting.

### PR Title

`Add skill: author/skill-name`

## Important

- This repository curates links only. Each skill lives in its own repo.
- Verify your links work before submitting.
- We review all submissions and may decline skills that don't meet the quality bar.
